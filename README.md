# Play Squared Frontend
-----------
## Overview
-----------
The project is a website that carries multiple browser-based  games that all function on a single square board. You can increase your board size to smaller or larger to make the gaming experience easier or more challenging.

On top of playing multiple games, you can request an idea for a game that you would like to see implemented to our library of games! It's a great place to be to have fun and share your creative thoughts about potential square games!

Upon completion of a game, if you have a score ranking in the top 10 highest scores, you will be featured on our leaderboard for all users to see!
