        <Card.Body>The team here at Play² is driven by the idea of making fun
          games focused around squares! Squares are always fun to
          play around with and are everywhere in the world. We often
          times look passed them, so we are here to highlight them!
          Our team wants to make as many square focused games as
          possible using our talents and the talents of everyone in our
          community! Have fun playing and creating here at Play²!</Card.Body>
