Potential Fixes:
Dry code in styles.js


A website to enjoy several different games revolved around Squares
2048(maybe)
Nickelodeon styled
2Fuse
Reflex 
Simon Says
Matching
Wordle
Connect 3(AI)
Math game to match squares and square roots

Clicking the name of the game will direct you to a 4x4 board to play
Users will need an account to play\
Highscores will be saved in database
Leaderboard for each game
Should be able to click users name and see all their high scores for each game
Feature to like/favorite games

WhiteBoard
Games need to be finished first. No CSS until they are finished
3 games minimum for completed project
I choose:
1.) Simon Says
2.) Math
3.) 2Fuse

Once games functional:
Set up databases
user authentication:
Leaderboard database:
Recommend a square game: (Full CRUD)

Each game will be a component OR each game is its own page

Leaderboard
The Leaderboard is not a Model
Use Game Model and pull from this Model\
to create the leaderboard
 Model 
 Game  
    name of game:
    scores: [
        {user: name,
        score: 0,
        date: today}
    ]
