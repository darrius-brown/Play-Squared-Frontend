SimonÂ² Notes
We have the board
After 1 second, make the board highlight a square a color
    Need to find the square we want to highlight
    
This square should be saved in an array
After 1 second, make the board unhighlight it
Then wait for a user to click the square
The users clicked square should be pushed into an array
Check after each click if the arrays match
